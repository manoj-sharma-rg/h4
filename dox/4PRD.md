# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Project Title
PMS-to-RGBridge Integration Platform

## 1. Overview
This product will automate and streamline the integration of new Property Management Systems (PMS) with the RGBridge platform. It will leverage GenAI for mapping and transformation, support multiple message formats, and provide a professional UI wizard for onboarding. The platform will be secure, extensible, and compliant with industry standards.

## 2. Goals & Objectives
- Rapid onboarding of new PMS partners with minimal manual intervention.
- Accurate, auditable translation of PMS messages to RGBridge format.
- Intuitive, professional UI for integration and mapping management.
- High reliability, security, and compliance (GDPR, PCI).

## 3. Features & Requirements
### 3.1. API Gateway
- Per-PMS endpoints (e.g., `/pms/{pmscode}`) for receiving messages.
- Support for JSON, XML, GraphQL, and SOAP formats.
- Authentication: basic, bearer, or API key.
- Logging and error handling.

### 3.2. PMS Plugin System
- Auto-discovery and registration of PMS translators via decorators or class-based plugins.
- Each PMS has its own folder with translator, mapping YAML, and tests.
- Plug-and-play extensibility for new PMS integrations.

### 3.3. Mapping Knowledge Base
- Static YAML mapping file per PMS, editable via UI.
- GenAI-powered mapping suggestion and transformation logic.
- Manual override and review for unclear mappings.

### 3.4. Validation & Transformation
- Schema validation for incoming PMS messages (JSON Schema, XSD, GraphQL SDL, WSDL).
- Outgoing RGBridge message validation against XSD.
- Utilities for date, currency, and LOS pattern parsing.

### 3.5. Outbound Delivery
- HTTP POST to internal API with XML payload and basic authentication.
- Retry logic, error handling, and acknowledgement.

### 3.6. Professional UI Wizard
- Step-by-step onboarding for new PMS integrations.
- Mapping review and edit interface.
- Test run and validation tools.
- User authentication and role-based access.

### 3.7. Testing & CI/CD
- Automated unit and integration tests for translators and mapping logic.
- CI/CD pipeline for build, test, and deployment.

### 3.8. Monitoring & Compliance
- Audit logging, monitoring, and alerting.
- GDPR and PCI compliance features.

## 4. User Stories
- **As an Integration Engineer**, I want to onboard a new PMS by uploading its schema and reviewing auto-generated mappings, so I can quickly enable new integrations.
- **As a Product Owner**, I want to see the status of all PMS integrations and mapping coverage, so I can track progress and quality.
- **As a QA Tester**, I want to run automated and manual tests on each PMS integration, so I can ensure correctness and reliability.
- **As a PMS Vendor**, I want to provide my message schema and test the integration, so I can verify compatibility.
- **As a Security/Compliance Officer**, I want audit logs and data minimization, so I can ensure regulatory compliance.

## 5. UI/UX Requirements
- Clean, modern, and responsive web UI.
- Wizard-driven onboarding for new PMS integrations.
- Mapping editor with GenAI suggestions and manual override.
- Test interface for uploading sample messages and viewing results.
- Role-based access control (admin, engineer, vendor, etc.).
- Accessible and internationalized (i18n) where possible.

## 6. Technical Requirements
- Python 3.10+ with FastAPI for backend.
- Frontend: React (preferred) or another modern JS framework.
- Plugin system for PMS translators (e.g., pluggy or custom registry).
- OpenAI API integration for mapping and transformation logic.
- Dockerized deployment, cloud-ready (AWS/Azure/GCP).
- Secure storage of secrets and credentials.
- Automated schema validation (JSON Schema, XSD, etc.).
- Comprehensive logging and monitoring.

## 7. Acceptance Criteria
- New PMS can be integrated end-to-end via the UI wizard with minimal manual mapping.
- All message formats (JSON, XML, GraphQL, SOAP) are supported and validated.
- RGBridge messages are correctly generated and validated against XSD.
- Outbound delivery to internal API is reliable, with retries and error handling.
- All integrations pass automated and manual tests.
- UI is intuitive, responsive, and supports mapping review/edit.
- System meets GDPR and PCI compliance requirements.
