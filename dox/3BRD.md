# Business Requirements Document (BRD)

## Project Title
PMS-to-RGBridge Integration Platform

## 1. Executive Summary
This project aims to automate and streamline the integration of new Property Management Systems (PMS) with the RGBridge platform using GenAI-driven mapping, validation, and transformation. The solution will support multiple PMS message formats (JSON, XML, GraphQL, SOAP), provide a professional UI for onboarding, and ensure compliance with industry standards.

## 2. Business Objectives
- Reduce time and effort required to onboard new PMS partners.
- Ensure accurate and reliable translation of PMS messages to RGBridge format.
- Provide a scalable, extensible, and secure integration platform.
- Enhance user experience with a professional UI and onboarding wizard.
- Maintain compliance with GDPR, PCI, and other relevant standards.

## 3. Stakeholders
- **Product Owner:** Oversees requirements and delivery.
- **Integration Engineers:** Implement and maintain PMS integrations.
- **QA/Testers:** Validate integrations and mappings.
- **PMS Vendors:** Provide message schemas and support onboarding.
- **Compliance & Security:** Ensure regulatory adherence.
- **End Users:** Benefit from seamless data flow and reduced manual work.

## 4. Scope
### In Scope
- API gateway for receiving PMS messages in various formats.
- Automated mapping and transformation to RGBridge format using GenAI.
- PMS plugin system for extensibility.
- Professional UI wizard for onboarding new PMS.
- Schema validation for incoming and outgoing messages.
- Outbound push of RGBridge messages to internal API.
- Error handling, logging, retry logic, and acknowledgements.
- Automated and manual mapping review.
- Unit and integration testing.
- CI/CD pipeline and cloud deployment.

### Out of Scope
- Changes to PMS vendor systems.
- Downstream systems beyond the RGBridge API.
- Manual data entry or legacy integration methods.

## 5. Functional Requirements
- Support for JSON, XML, GraphQL, and SOAP PMS message formats.
- Per-PMS API gateway endpoints with authentication (basic, bearer, API key).
- Auto-discovery and registration of PMS translators via plugin system.
- Static mapping knowledge base (YAML) per PMS, GenAI-augmented.
- GenAI-powered mapping suggestion and transformation logic.
- Schema validation for incoming PMS and outgoing RGBridge messages.
- Outbound HTTP POST to internal API with XML and basic authentication.
- Error handling, retries, and acknowledgement responses.
- Professional UI wizard for PMS onboarding, mapping review, and test runs.
- Automated tests for translators and mapping logic.
- Audit logging and monitoring.

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements
- **Security:** GDPR and PCI compliance, secure authentication, encrypted secrets.
- **Performance:** Low-latency message processing, scalable architecture.
- **Reliability:** High availability, retry logic, error handling.
- **Extensibility:** Plug-and-play PMS integration, minimal code changes for new PMS.
- **Usability:** Intuitive UI for onboarding and mapping management.
- **Documentation:** Comprehensive developer and user documentation.

## 7. Constraints
- Must use Python (FastAPI recommended).
- Must support cloud deployment (Docker, AWS/Azure/GCP).
- Mapping logic must be explainable and auditable.
- All data handling must comply with GDPR and PCI standards.

## 8. Risks & Mitigations
- **Unclear PMS mappings:** Use GenAI and manual review for ambiguous cases.
- **Schema changes by PMS vendors:** Version control and update process for mappings.
- **Compliance risks:** Regular audits and automated checks.
- **Integration failures:** Automated tests and monitoring.

## 9. Success Criteria
- New PMS can be onboarded with minimal manual effort.
- Accurate translation and delivery of messages to RGBridge API.
- All integrations pass automated and manual tests.
- Positive feedback from users on UI and onboarding process.
- No compliance or security incidents.

## 10. Open Questions
- Are there any specific SLAs for message processing?
- What is the expected volume of PMS integrations per year?
- Are there preferred cloud providers or deployment targets?
- Who will maintain the mapping knowledge base long-term?
